# CSS Graffiti Override Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use the browser developer tools
- Override existing styles

## Introduction

Imagine that you are walking down the street, and you notice that there's a
mural that has been painted over with various graffiti tags. In reality,
cleaning this up could be a challenging feat; however, in CSS, you have the
power to manipulate the DOM with just a line or two of code and to restore the
mural to its original look! In this lab, we've created a virtual wall. Using
only CSS, how can you remove the unsightly tags?

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code. Finally, run `npm install` to install the lab's dependencies. Run
`npm test` as you go to see your test progress.

## Use the Browser Developer Tools

Assuming you have opened the index file in Chrome, open the [dev tools][tools].
You can quickly access Chrome dev tools with the keyboard shortcut
`Cmd+Option+i` on a Mac, or by right/control-clicking anywhere in the window and
selecting `inspect`.

Inspect the elements of the graffiti wall in the dev tools by hovering over and
clicking on nested elements. Take a close look at what's made available to you
in the dev tools pane. You can see which style sheets specific style
declarations live in, as well as create new styles on the fly. Now, make note of
the CSS styles used to add graffiti tags (as background images) to the wall.

## Override Existing Styles

In the file `css/cleanup.css`, write selectors that have more specificity
(authority) than those that are showing the graffiti tags. You can test out
writing classes in dev tools by clicking the `+` in the top right-hand corner of
the pane. You can also click the `sources` tab and select `css/cleanup.css` in
the dev tools pane. This allows you to edit the CSS file directly. It _won't_
save your edits, but it will give a live update of changes so that it's easier
to manipulate the DOM without refreshing the page. From there, you can copy and
paste your working changes into the file.

To remove the tags, use the CSS declaration `display:none;`. It will change the
elements' previous display property value from `display: block` to
`display: none`, which will hide that graffiti.

For example, for "tag-1" the developer tools reveal that the style applying the
graffiti here is:

```css
.tag-1 {
  background: url(../images/tag-1.png) no-repeat;
  z-index: 7;
  display: block;
}
```

You'll need to override this by setting its display to `display: none;` instead.
We can do this by writing a selector statement that is more specific such as:

```css
#wall .tag-1 {
  display: none;
}
```

This selects elements with a class of "tag-1" that happen to also be inside an
element with an id of "wall". This is more specific, and therefore will override
the previous statement and hide the graffiti. For more info on how specificity
in CSS works take a look at: [Smashing Magazines What You Need to Know About CSS
Specificity][smash]. You can also take advantage of a [Specificity
Calculator][spec-calc] to assist with finding and understanding options for
overriding styles.

**Do not use the CSS `!important` value**! It is considered a bad practice and
should be used sparingly, in very specific edge-cases. For this lab, avoid
adding inline or embedded CSS to the index.html file, or any additional class or
id attributes to the index.html file either. This will make it more challenging
as you will have to write CSS that is more specific based on the existing
markup.

## Moving On

When you're ready to leave this lab, run `npm test` from the command line to
confirm you've passed all tests.

## Saving Your Work Remotely

Currently, the work you've done on this assignment is only on your local
machine. To preserve work on your GitHub fork, you will need to stage the
changes you've made, commit them, and push the commit up to GitHub. Use the
following commands to do this:

```console
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Completed assignment"
$ git push
```

If you visit your fork on GitHub, you should now see that _you've_ made the most
recent commit, and your solution will be present in the files.

## Conclusion

With the dev tools and resources on CSS specificity rules, work your way through
all seven graffiti pictures until the wall is fully clean. In your
experimentation, you will find that there are many ways to manipulate and
override the DOM. This will become a common practice as you build out more
complex websites or work with cloud-hosted third-party resources where you may
not have direct access to the style sheet.
